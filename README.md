The class should be developed without any using of framework or ready libraries 
(you can use libraries, that've been developed by your own).
The practical test should demonstrate your practical skills in the development with using:
PHP 7+, JavaScript (JQuery), Twitter Bootstrap (optional), HTML, CSS, AJAX.

This link was used to make an array with the country prefix and name https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes
If you can't validate a prefix, then: 07, 02, 03 are Romanian mobile numbers, else German mobile numbers.
It must be a fully functional page that can add/retrieve/detete/search phone numbers for demonstration how it works.

00 will be converted to +
'-' and space will be replaced with NULL
